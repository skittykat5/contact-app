I probably didn't finish this app, but here's some information about it:

-I used MERN stack: that's MongoDB, Express, React, Node.
-I also used React Bootstrap for some quick styling.

-It definitely won't run on your PC unless I add your IP to the MongoDB cloud, but hypothetically if you were to do that, you could run it by doing the following:

    -cd into Server
    -npm install
    -node server.js

    -cd into contact-app
    -npm install
    -npm start

-Also, the edit page isn't fully working. I think it's just a small bug, but I'm running out of time.

-Screenshots are in the screenshot folder.
